# GTA VI Countdown

A simple countdown timer to check how many days are left until the release of **Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI)**. Although it is only available for **PS5** and **Xbox** at launch, this project brings you one step closer to the excitement of its release!

### Features:
- A countdown timer displaying the days remaining until GTA VI is released.
- Simple animations with Tailwind CSS to give a clean and minimal look.
- Inspired by the official GTA VI website, but with a focus on simplicity and performance.
- Built with a responsive, mobile-first approach.
  
### Tech Stack:
- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
  
### Future Plans:
- **GSAP Integration**: Initially, I plan to integrate GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for more advanced animations, but after experimenting, I found that copying the exact features of the original website caused lag. So, I will keep things simple with basic animations to maintain performance.
